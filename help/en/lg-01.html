Except if specifically allowed within the Service, you acknowledge that you may not create multiple Accounts and that you will immediately close your additional Account upon Playwing's request. Playwing advises you not to include your surname in your Username. You agree to your Username being publicly displayed in the course of the use of the Services. Playwing reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, a Username in its sole discretion.

Do not reveal the Password of your Account to outside parties. We are not responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your Account. Playwing will never ask you to reveal your Password and will never take the initiative of contacting you to ask you for the memory joggers associated with your Password. We reserve the right to suspend your access to the Services and change (or require you to change) your Password at any time. Any use of your Account with your Password, and in particular any purchase of Services, is deemed to be carried out by you.

                                        You acknowledge and accept that Playwing may take action to check the accuracy of the information you give, including by carrying out undefined checks of any landline or mobile telephone number and/or e-mail address you have given for a parent or legal guardian when applicable. In order to protect other Users and prevent risks of fraud, you agree to send the necessary authorizations and supporting documents to Playwing on request by e-mail, fax or post.

                            VIRTUAL MONEY
                            <p>
                                Our Games may include virtual currencies ("Virtual Money") or items or services for use with our Games ("Virtual Goods"). You agree that once purchased Virtual Money and Virtual Goods have no monetary value and can never be exchanged for real money, real goods or real services from us or anyone else. You agree that Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods are not transferrable to anyone else and you will not transfer or attempt to transfer any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods to anyone else.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You do not own Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money but instead you purchase a limited personal revocable license to use them - any balance of Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money does not reflect any stored value.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods are final and that we will not refund any transaction once it has been made. If you live in the European Union you have certain rights to withdraw from distance purchases; however, please note that when you purchase a license to use Virtual Goods or Virtual Money from us, you acknowledge and agree that we will begin the provision of the Virtual Goods or Virtual Money to you promptly once your purchase is complete and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost at this point. For the purposes of this clause, a "purchase" is complete at the time our servers validate your purchase and the applicable Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money are successfully credited to your account on our servers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you do not connect your Game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or a Playwing account, we will not be able to restore any Virtual Money or other data associated with your Game play to a different device if you lose that device or it is damaged. Accordingly, on a device which is not connected in this way:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                    any risk of loss of Virtual Money which you purchase from us is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase as described in this clause;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    any risk of loss of Virtual Money that you receive from us without making a purchase is transferred to you at the time the Virtual Money is successfully credited to your account on our servers; and
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    any risk of loss of other data associated with your Game play (including, without limitation, your progress through the Game, or the level or score you have reached in our Games) is transferred to you immediately at the time such Game play data is generated.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The data associated with Virtual Goods, whether purchased by you using Virtual Money or otherwise credited or awarded to you, is stored locally on your device and so is not synced between different devices even if you have connected your game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or Playwing account. Accordingly, any risk of loss of this data is transferred to you (i) in the case of Virtual Goods which you purchase from us, upon completion of the purchase as described above; and/or (ii) in other cases, at the time the Virtual Goods are credited or awarded to you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you live in the European Union, we will provide you with a VAT invoice where we are required to do so by law or where requested by you. You agree that these invoices may be electronic in format.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.

                            <p>
                                We may revise the pricing for Virtual Goods and Virtual Money offered through the Services at any time. We may limit the total amount of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total amount of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods that may be held in your account in the aggregate. You are only allowed to obtain Virtual Money and Virtual Goods from us or our authorized partners through the Services, and not in any other way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Depending on your platform, any Virtual Goods or Virtual Money purchased is purchased from your platform provider and such purchase will be subject to its terms of service and user agreement. Usage rights for each purchase may differ from item to item. If you are unsure about usage rights you should check with your platform before making a purchase. Unless otherwise shown, content available in any in-game store has the same age rating as the game.

                                If we suspend or terminate your account in accordance with these terms you may lose any Virtual Money and Virtual Goods that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you.

                                The charge for any individual item you can purchase via our Website shall be as stated on our Website at the time you place the order, except in the case of obvious error. The charge is inclusive of all sales taxes and other charges. Depending on which bank you use, additional charges may be issued by your bank; we have no control over this and accept no liability in relation to the same. If you are unsure whether you will be subject to such additional charges then you should check with your bank before making a purchase via our Website. We accept payment via our payment processing partners by credit card, debit card and carrier billing only. Our payment processing partners may have their own terms and conditions and you should ensure you are in agreement with these prior to making any payment. If your transaction with our payment processing partners is not successful then your purchase will not be fulfilled. Upon the completion of a successful payment transaction then your purchase will be fulfilled to you as soon as possible - we will endeavor to fulfill your order immediately at the point of purchase.

                                        The headings of the clauses are intended solely to facilitate reading and understanding of these Terms and may in no case allow any assumption to be made as to the content of the clauses and the way in which they may be interpreted.
